I'm a developer. I enjoy using the power of computers to solve real world problems. To bridge the gap between the idea and the actual product.

Most of the code I write is open sourced and lives on [GitHub]({{ site.links.github }}). Go take a look!

As a developer I'm constantly learning new things for new projectsâ€” technology evolves and so should I. Do you have a challenge for me?
