Design. Maybe the most important part of every project. It's where it all begins. When I think of design I **don't** just think of creating shiny objectsâ€” everything needs to be designed. You can't build a proper house without a proper plan.

The key to a good design is understanding. You *need* to understand the user and their needs in order to create a fitting design. If you don't understand everything is pure guesswork.
