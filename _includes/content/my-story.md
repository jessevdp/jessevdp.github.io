My name is Jesse van der Pluijm. I'm a student, programmer and designer from the Netherlands who loves music, sports and life itself ðŸ˜‡

I'm a fan of kitesurfing, snowboarding, hiking & kickboxing.

I'm constantly learning new things. Anything I don't yet understand is a challenge to tackle in the future. Do you have a challenge for me?
