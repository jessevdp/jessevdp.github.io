Creating a logo isn't all that difficult once you have a direction, luckily I got some directions. The yoga studio would be named after the greek deity [gaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(mythology)). Besides that I was handed a piece of wallpaper.

>In Greek mythology, Gaia, also spelled Gaea, is the personification of the Earth and one of the Greek primordial deities. Gaia is the ancestral mother of all life: the primal Mother Earth goddess. She is the immediate parent of Uranus (the sky), from whose sexual union she bore the Titans (themselves parents of many of the Olympian gods) and the Giants, and of Pontus (the sea), from whose union she bore the primordial sea gods. Her equivalent in the Roman pantheon was Terra.

I started off translating the wallpaper shapes into a somewhat human like form to meet the form of the goddess. The first sketches look horrible and are nowhere near finished... But you have to start somewhere!

Since Gaia is the personification of the Earth itself (according to Greek mythology), I wanted the shape to resemble that. The shape would need a lot more body. The bottom half of the logo got redesigned. The end result resembles a sort of praying stance often associated with yoga.

The color of the shape, green, was chosen because of the obvious association with nature.
